  \section{Signal Processing}
  One major area where fourier series are used is signal
  processing. They allow you to disect a signal and analyize
  it's component parts among other things. The particular use
  we will be looking at this section is how to record and reproduce
  a bandlimited signal digitally with no loss of information.
  This is of particular interest to the music industry as they
  need a way to record, store, and reproduce sound on computers.

  \subsection{Recording}
  The primary issue is that sound and other signals are continuous
  while digital computers are inherintly discrete. Thus we need
  to sample at some high enough frequency so as to not lose any
  information. Intuitively this feels like it would be impossible,
  surely if you sample finitely many points something could happen
  inbetween them that they wouldn't register. This turns out to not
  be the case for band limited signals as we will soon see.

  Let $x(t)$ be some signal and $X(\omega)$ be it's
  spectrum, which is a map from a frequencey to it's
  strength in the signal. It is apparent if you know $x(t)$
  you can compute $X(\omega)$ and if you know $X(\omega)$
  you can compute $x(t)$. Thus $x$ and $X$ uniquely determine
  eachother.
  We will assume that the signal is band limited, i.e. no
  frequencies above or below a certain level. In the case of
  sound even if your signal is not bandlimited our hearing is,
  so you can just get rid of frequencies outside of our range.
  We will also assume your signal is nice enough to have a
  fourier series representation naturally produced signals such
  as sound are this nice.

  The relation between $x(t)$ and $X(\omega)$ can be given by:
  \[x(t) = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^\infty
  X(\omega)e^{it\omega}\,d\omega\]
  However as we are band limited we know that if
  $|\omega| > \frac{B}{2\pi}$ for some $B$ that
  $X(\omega) = 0$ thus our integral becomes
  \[x(t) = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-2\pi B}^{2\pi B}
  X(\omega)e^{it\omega}\,d\omega\]
  Next we choose some time interval to sample our signal at.
  For instance consider sampling at the intervals $\frac{n}{2B}$
  where $n \in \mathbb{Z}$. This yields:
  \[x\left(\frac{n}{2B}\right) =
  \int_{-2\pi B}^{2\pi B}X(\omega)e^{\frac{itn}{2B}}\,d\omega\]
  This, however, is just the $n^{\text{th}}$ fourier coeffecient
  of $X(\omega)$ so we have:
  \[x\left(\frac{n}{2B}\right) = \hat{X}(n)\]
  Thus if we sample our signal at regular intervals of
  $n/2B$ we will get our fourier series for $X(n)$ which
  uniquely determines $X(n)$ which uniquely determines $x(t)$.

  \subsection{Recreation}
  Now let's assume you have these data points at $t=\frac{n}{2B}$
  how would you go about recreating the sound?
